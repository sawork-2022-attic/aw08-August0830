# aw08

Run the project with `mvn spring-boot:run` and send request to `http://localhost:8080/check`. You should see an reponses in json format like the following.

```json
{
    "icon_url": "https://assets.chucknorris.host/img/avatar/chuck-norris.png",
    "id": "kswv7NIaTCaIIErlBzODaA",
    "url": "https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/kswv7NIaTCaIIErlBzODaA",
    "value": "Chuck Norris's shadow weighs 250 pounds and can kick your ass ."
}
```

Try to understand the provided code which demonstrates spring integration between a spring boot application with an externel http service (https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random).

Please implement delivery as an standalone service (just like the random joke service). Refer the sample code to integrate your Micropos system with delivery service so that user can check delivery status on Miropos which actually forwards user request to delivery service on demand.

Consider the advantage by doing so and write it down in your readme file.



My opinions of the advantage by doing so:

I can design the delivery service independently instead of considering order service like I did in AW07. In other words, I can use third-party delivery service as long as I make order service to fit the message protocol between them.

I can choose diverse way for services to communicate. In this case I use Http Interface in Java Integration but I can improve the performance of my service with other message api like rabbitmq. So integration offers flexibility for developer to design the communication structure between service.
